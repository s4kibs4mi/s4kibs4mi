### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is Sakib and I am a Tech Entrepreneur, Software Engineer, Open Source Enthusiast.

I also use few other social networks but I don't think that will be interesting for you.

I bring over 8 years of experience in large-scale software design and development, specializing in backend systems.

Before Twilio, I worked at [Pathao](https://pathao.com/?lang=en) as a Software Engineer, where I designed and deployed scalable service infrastructure using Docker and Kubernetes. I also co-founded [Shopemaa](https://shopemaa.com), where I built a scalable headless eCommerce API using Golang, PostgreSQL, and Docker. Earlier in my career, I held roles as a Senior Software Engineer at Nybbles Systems and East West Media Group in Bangladesh.

I have built [Shopemaa](https://shopemaa.com/) a small SaaS platform that offers headless eCommerce API.
